==========
Basic Flask directory structure minus the empty templates folder, which is not used in the basic Hello World app


Details from the talk:
----------------------

Before giving the talk, setup instructions were sent out to have: Python, pip, and virtualenv. I found it really helpful for newer Python programmers to get a version of Python with pip included, in Python 2 in versions 2.7.9 and later and in Python 3 in versions 3.4 and later. For Windows users, I suggested the use of Nitrous.IO for the purpose of this talk. 

Version 2 of the slides from uMAD 2015: [PDF](http://taylorbar.net/uMAD_Intro_to_Web_Dev.pdf)

Currently, I am working on improving this talk, including the quality of the slides. It is meant to be interactive and easy to follow along with. I also want to clean up my setup instructions that was given ahead of time to attendees. 

To run Hello World program once environment is setup:
----------------------------------------------------

<code>python app.py</code>
